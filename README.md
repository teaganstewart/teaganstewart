### Hello! Welcome to my Github :)
This is the home of some of my personal and university coding projects. <br> <br>

After recently graduating from Victoria University of Wellington, I am spending my free time working on gaining experience with a variety of coding languages. Currently, I am working on the 100 Day Euler Project Challenge with the freeCodeCamp, where we produce solutions to the first 100 Euler Project problems. Through this I am learning C# and progressing on C, C++ and JavaScript. <br>

I am currently trying to make a web version of a chess game, so I am improving my HTML and CSS skills. My aim is to make a good, responsive web design and code my attempt at a simple chess API.<br>

You can contact me through my LinkedIn for any business or personal requests. - https://www.linkedin.com/in/teagan-stewart-7675421bb/
