### Hello! Welcome to my Github :)
This is the home of some of my personal and university coding projects. <br> 

Currently working as a datal processor, I am spending my free time continuing to practice my programming skills. Currently, I am making a text based chess program using JavaScript and hope to continue developing it into a GUI using a framework (probably react). I mainly work with JavaScript, but have previously worked a lot with C#, Java, Python, HTML and CSS.<br>

I enjoy programming as I enjoy creating products that I am proud of, and am always excited for the end product. I also enjoy the problem solving aspect of trying to find out why a big isn't working then trying to fix it until it works as expected. Finding a bug and producing high quality work motivates me to continue. <br>

You can contact me through my LinkedIn for any business or personal requests. - https://www.linkedin.com/in/teagan-stewart-7675421bb/
